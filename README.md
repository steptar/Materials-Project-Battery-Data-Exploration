### Materials Project Battery Data Exploration ###
This repository contains a jupyter notebook which explores, analyzes, and visualizes battery data obtained from the Materials Project (https://materialsproject.org/#search/batteries). The exploration focuses on the properties of five common working ions: Zinc (Zn), Aluminum (Al), Magnesium (Mg), Potassium (K) and Lithium (Li).
